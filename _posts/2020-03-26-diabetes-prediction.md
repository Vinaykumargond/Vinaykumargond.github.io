Diabetes Prediction is my weekend practice project. In this model I used KNN Neighbors Classifier to trained model that is used to predict the positive or negative result. Given set of inputs are BMI(Body Mass Index),BP(Blood Pressure),Glucose Level,Insulin Level based on this features it predict whether you have diabetes or not.
